SONAR is an abbreviated form of Sound Navigation and Ranging. It uses sound waves to detect objects underwater. Machine learning-based tactics, and deep learning-based approaches have applications in detecting sonar signals and hence targets.\n","\n","Fourier transform, wavelet transform, limit cycle, etc. are signal processing methods applicable for an underwater acoustic signal. Machine Learning enables the processing of sonar signals and target detection. It is a subfield of artificial intelligence which tells machines how to manipulate data more proficiently. The three stages of Machine Learning are taking some data as input, extracting features, and predicting new patterns. The most common ML algorithms in this field are Logistic Regression, support vector machine, principal component analysis, k-nearest neighbors (KNN), C-means clustering,
